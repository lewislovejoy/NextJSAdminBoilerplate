This is a NextJS blueprint for an Admin Console (with login).

Once I'd built an Electron version, I decided to do the same in NextJS
(so you can either have a Desktop App or a Web based Admin console depending on 
the use case).

Same caveats as the Electron App, its just an MVP for an Admin Console
with no real content or business login - as bare bones as you can get while
still being the main scaffolding for a production App

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

and that's about it, point your borwser at http://localhost:3000 and you're there
